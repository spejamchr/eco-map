# EcoMap

Generate a random map containing different ecological biomes.

Inspired by Pokemon Sapphire & Zelda: BOTW.

Each square tile in the map is the size of a player character like in Pokemon Sapphire, and the
world is huge & open with a time system & regenerative events--so bad guys come back--like in BOTW.

## Wishlist (in order of priority)

- Believable variability in elevation, temperature, and humidity/precipitation across location
- Lots of biomes (forest, plains, lakes, rivers, desert, tundra, icebergs, mountains, rain forests,
  volcanos, oceans, etc...)
- Towns & Villages in sensible areas
- Roads & paths between important places
- Time system with day/night
- Temperature & weather vary with time
- Rain, snow, storms, hurricanes
